# WordPress Template Hierachy Theme

My **WordPress starting point** for building websites. A minimalist theme that can be useful for developers or for those who are looking to understand the [WordPress Template Hierarchy](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-hierarchy/) since each template is visually identified. https://pixelius.es/forma/wordpress-starter

Includes the following templates: 404, archive, author, category, footer, front-page, header, home, index, page, page-sidebar, search, sidebar, sidebar-blog, single, tag.

The loading of CSS and JS is done through the functions.php file.
